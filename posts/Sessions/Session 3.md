[[Session 2]]

We trounce [[Bolan]] and his little dog too

We find some fantasy LSD and have a big sleep

We freed the gnomes

Bloan has given the key to Kaneepo

Being paid 50gp by Lemma to retrieve (25 upfront)

Headed to the Stacks

Footnote in PF Chronicles, describing a Colourless Forest located in the realm of Nighthold ruled by Count Ranalc
* Ruled by "the slim"

We heist the weathercock
